# Roll The Dice Game

# Game Design
The player throws a pair of dice. The sum of the two top faces is what matters. If the player throws a 7 or 11 on the first throw, the player wins. If the player throws a 2, 3, or 12, the player loses. For any other result, this result is called point and a follow-up throw is required. On follow-up throws, a 7 throw loses and a throw of the playerâ€™s point wins. For anything else, the game continues with the follow-up throw rules.
