# Treasure Hunter Game

# Game Design
A game of object-collection and enemy-avoidance game, where the explorer (hunter) explores a field for a treasure (chest) and has to take it back to the door (exit) while avoiding the blobs (monsters) in the field, every collison between the explorer and a blob will cause a portion of his health to be deducted. If he failed to return with the treasure to the door while maintaining his health, you lose the game. otherwise, it you successfully returned to the door with the treasure, you win!
